# Homework Manual

## Description

This repository contains the homework manual for SSW-345. It includes various sections and tasks as part of the assignment.

## Homework Tasks

1. **Part I: Setting up LaTeX and Overleaf**  
   Set up LaTeX and Overleaf to streamline document creation. Uploaded instructor-provided files to Overleaf and learned to structure documents using LaTeX commands. This setup avoids local installations and simplifies real-time editing.

2. **Part II: Learning Git**  
   Used Learn Git Branching to practice Git commands like git branch, git checkout, git merge, git rebase, git cherry-pick, and git tag. This improved my version control skills. Completion marks are shown below.

3. **Part III: Create a GitHub Issue**  
   Created a GitHub issue to track homework tasks, demonstrating the importance of clear documentation for effective project management.
